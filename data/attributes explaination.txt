water:
ObjectID: original id.
nodelabel: what appears in map originally.
nodetype: 1 for storage tank, 2 pumping station, 3 for end-user node


power:
objectID
nodelabel
notetype: 1 for gate station, 2 for 23 kv substation,3 for 12 kv substation. 
When combined with water nodes, values of attributes of water nodes remain the same while the values for power node is equal to x+100 except for the cooordinates.

Note: power lines are treated as straight lines to calculate Pf for now. Pf=1-exp[-(RR_start+RR_end)/2*L)]
      In relaity, power lines are curves.

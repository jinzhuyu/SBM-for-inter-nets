function [sp, spcost] = dijkstraties(matriz_costo, s, d)
%
% This function is built on the dijkstra.m function written by Jorge
% Ignacia Barrera Alviar (April 2008), available at
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange under file ID 5550.
% Modification records all ties for shortest path.
%
%
% I have also been trying, unsuccessfully, so modify the code so that
% instead of adding the costs of each edge to compute total path costs,
% the cost of traveling along edges e1 and 2 is equal to 1 - (1-coste1)(1-coste2).
% This formulation is useful if the costs represent hazard rates, and the
% goal is find the path that minimizes the probability of loss from node s
% to node d (or maximizes the probability of survival).
%
% My attempt to modify the code in the latter manner is commented out.
% Code to be removed is commented "Switch # (add)" and code to substituted
% in its place is labeled "Switch # (mult)". If one were to output the the 
% prev array, one would see that it isn't
% generated properly which the code switch is performed. However the dist
% vector does appear to be generated correctly.
%
% Any help in getting the code to work properly while computing costs
% as 1 minus the product of survival probabilities  would be greatly 
% appreciated.

%%%%%%%%%% Original documentation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This is an implementation of the dijkstra´s algorithm, wich finds the 
% minimal cost path between two nodes. It´s supoussed to solve the problem on 
% possitive weighted instances.


% The inputs are the same is with the original code. Because the original
% documentation is not clear with respect to the array matriz_costo, 
% matriz_costo is an n x n adjacency matrix where the (i,j) element
% represents the cost of traveling along the edge linking node i to node j. 
% One should not set any elements to 0 (unless your intention is that there 
% is no cost to travel along the corresponding edge). Typically I choose 
% some arbitrarily large number for all elements representing non-edges.

% the inputs of the algorithm are:
%farthestNode: the farthest node to reach for each node after performing
% the routing;
% n: the number of nodes in the network;
% s: source node index;
% d: destination node index;

%For information about this algorithm visit:
%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

%This implementatios is inspired by the Xiaodong Wang's implememtation of
%the dijkstra's algorithm, available at
%http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange
